# Olympics Project

My first app - built in week 4 at CodeClan. Ruby project which records participation of athletes and rankings using 
PostgreSQL and Sinatra.


## MVP

Create a web app which allows the results for the Rio Olympics to be searched and displayed. The app should allow a user to:
- search for results by country and by athlete
- allow a user to add nations, athletes and nations
- possible additional functionality may include the ability to update and delete athletes, events and nations
